/* 
HW 2 - Pig Latin
Kady Tran

- If a word begins with a vowel, the letter remains in place and 'way' is appended to the end of the word
- If a word begins with one consonant, that letter is moved to the end and 'ay' is appended
- If a word begins with two consonants, both letters are moved to the end and 'ay' is appended

- Use JS strings and conditional logic to write a program that accepts text input and prints out the Pig Latin translation according to the above rules. 
- If the user enters nothing or a single-letter word, your program should print out a message that says "the input can't be translated."
